Image(s) were replaced manually on the server, such as cover.jpg from a small\r\n   size to a larger size.\r\n2. Image(s) name(s) or path(s) were updated in the database and were replaced\r\n   manually on the server.\r\n   For example, from public://publication/1.jpg to public://article/01.jpg\r\n\r\nIn particular, the {file_managed.filesize} and the {file_managed.timestamp}\r\ncolumns will be incorrect after making these changes and the image dimension\r\nin the field_data_filename table will be incorrect as well.\r\n\r\nThis module will rebuild said information and then update them in database.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nInstallation is quite simple:\r\n\r\nEnable the module from admin/modules or use Drush:\r\n\r\ndrush pm-enable utility_image_rebuild\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe Utility Image Rebuild module is dependent on two Drupal 7 core modules:\r\nfile\r\nimage\r\n\r\nYou will be prompted to enable these modules if they are not already enabled.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
